Charioteer of Delphi

- One of the most important sculptures of ancient greece because it represents the passage from the Archaic conventions to the Classical ideals.
- It exemplifies the balance between geometric representation and idealized realism. 
- The charioteerâ€™s garment, called the xystis, is the typical chiton that all chariot drivers wore during the race.
